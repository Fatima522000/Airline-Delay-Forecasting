# Airline Delay Analysis and Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting airline delays using real-world historical flight data. The workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing (handling missing values and outliers), exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns, feature engineering to enhance predictive power, and building machine learning models (such as ARIMA, ARIMAX, and LightGBM) for delay forecasting. The goal is to identify the main causes of flight delays and provide actionable insights for mitigation
